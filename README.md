## üåè Welcome to WalkLand üåè


WalkLand is a final group projected created by students at Dev Academy.

Original project refactored and updated, in addition to having new features added,
by Hamish Stobo.
Expanded project live at http://walkland-app.herokuapp.com/


## What is Walkland?
We want everyone to enjoy the beauty that Auckland has to provide.
We have selected some of the best walks in Auckland in order to provide you with succinct and concentrated information about the walks.
Feel free to have a browse through the site and see what's going on!


## What can Walkland do?
Walking is lovely. It's refreshing, it's invigorating, it's just plain 'ol good.
Sure, it might be easy to find these walks, but we wanted to create a community of walkers, for walkers.
Sharing your experiences with others makes it enjoyable for everyone else, and it'll allow them to select the best of the walks.
How? Just register with us, and then you'll be able to create new ratings and review which will allow the community to see your experiences of the walks!


## What's up next for Walkland?
Walkland was created from the ground up in 7 days. There's a few extra things that we'd love for Walkland to do.
1. Post photos of the walks
2. Create community walks
3. Badges!
4. Not only walks but other things to do within walking distance
5. etc.


## Donations
Building an app is fun, but it also takes a good amount of time. Feel free to support us with a meal, coffee or something!


## Would you like to contribute?
Everything is OPEN! Feel free to join and be a part of the team at Walkland!
