WalkLand is a final group projected created by students at Dev Academy.

## DEVELOPMENT

GIT AND GITHUB

**Fixing merge conflicts**
--KEEP CURRENT CHANGES: Deletes all incoming changes from the incoming branch, and keeps your code.
--ACCEPT INCOMING CHANGES: Replaces your code with the incoming changes
--ACCEPT BOTH CHANGES: Keeps your code and adds the code from the incoming branch.

**PULLING FROM DEV:
you want to update your branch with changes from dev and keep working**

Checkout to your branch, add and commit your changes. Then

`git pull origin dev`

Fix any merge conflicts, update dependencies if needed with npm i, test everything works by running the server with `npm run dev`, and if everything works, add & commit changes and keep working.

**PUSHING TO DEV:
you want to push your changes to the remote dev branch so you can add them to the working version of the project**

 add and commit changes in the branch you're working on. Then:
 
 `git checkout dev`        puts you in the local dev branch.
 `git pull origin dev`      pulls down any changes from the repo on github.
 
 Fix any merge conflicts.
 
 Make sure to run `npm i` to update dependencies, and run the server with `npm run dev` to test that your local dev branch is working.
 Add and commit once merge conflicts are fixed and you've tested that the local dev branch is working.
 
 THEN,
 `git merge <your local branch name>`
  Fix merge conflicts
  Install dependencies if packagelock.json changed
  Run the server with `npm run dev` to test that dev works with your changes
  If everything works great, then:
  
 Run `git pull origin dev` if you think the remote dev branch has changed while you were merging your local branch to local dev branch.
 Fix any merge conflicts, add & commit, then run `git push origin dev`. 
 Otherwise:
 add & commit your changes, the run `git push origin dev`
