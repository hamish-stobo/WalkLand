Auckland is a lovely city, located within some of the most beautiful parts of New Zealand.
Yet, people search far and wide, unbeknownst to the beauty that Auckland can provide, just a short distance away.
We want to be able to share this amazing city called Auckland, and allow people to be aware of some of the most beautiful walks that Auckland has to provide.

We hope you enjoy your time in Walkland.

## Before you start
The app hasn't been deployed, and the working branch is dev.
Please make sure you are on the dev branch before installing!


## Installing
Firstly, install all the required packages by running:
```java
$ npm install
```


## Executing the app
Nice and easy:
```java
$ npm run walkland
```


## What is Walkland?
We want everyone to enjoy the beauty that Auckland has to provide.
We have selected some of the best walks in Auckland in order to provide you with succinct and concentrated information about the walks.
Feel free to have a browse through the site and see what's going on!


## What can Walkland do?
Walking is lovely. It's refreshing, it's invigorating, it's just plain 'ol good.
Sure, it might be easy to find these walks, but we wanted to create a community of walkers, for walkers.
Sharing your experiences with others makes it enjoyable for everyone else, and it'll allow them to select the best of the walks.
How? Just register with us, and then you'll be able to create new ratings and review which will allow the community to see your experiences of the walks!


## What's up next for Walkland?
Walkland was created from the ground up in 7 days. There's a few extra things that we'd love for Walkland to do.
1. Post photos of the walks
2. Create community walks
3. Badges!
4. Not only walks but other things to do within walking distance
5. etc.


## Donations
Building an app is fun, but it also takes a good amount of time. Feel free to support us with a meal, coffee or something!
